## 📊 CMS Medicare Spending Per Beneficiary (MSPB) Analysis

---

## 📌 Project Overview

**Medicare Spending per Beneficiary (MSPB)** is a CMS metric that measures how much Medicare spends on a hospital episode relative to the national average.

- 🟢 **MSPB = 1.00** → Equal to national average  
- 📉 **MSPB < 1.00** → More cost-efficient  
- 📈 **MSPB > 1.00** → Higher spending than average  

This project delivers an **end-to-end healthcare analytics and business intelligence solution** that evaluates hospital cost efficiency, identifies spending drivers, and examines whether **higher Medicare spending correlates with better hospital outcomes, ownership type, or geographic location**.

The final output is an **executive-ready Power BI dashboard** backed by a **SQL-driven analytical model**.

---

## 🏥 What This Project Does

This repository contains a complete analytics workflow that:

- Cleans and validates CMS MSPB data using **Python**
- Models reusable analytical views in **SQL Server**
- Enriches MSPB data with **Hospital General Information**
- Prevents duplicate inflation through **window-function-based deduplication**
- Visualizes insights using **Power BI** (SQL-first design, minimal DAX)

**Workflow Overview**

📥 Data ingestion → 🧹 Cleaning & validation → 🗄️ SQL Server modeling → 📊 Power BI visuals → 📈 Executive insights

## ❓ What Is MSPB?

**Medicare Spending per Beneficiary (MSPB)** compares Medicare spending for a hospital episode (3 days before admission through 30 days post-discharge) to the national average.

- 🟢 **MSPB = 1.00** → National average spending  
- 📉 **MSPB < 1.00** → More efficient spending  
- 📈 **MSPB > 1.00** → Higher than average spending  

This project combines **CMS MSPB** with **Hospital General Information** to evaluate spending differences by:

- State
- Hospital ownership
- Hospital quality rating

---

## 📌 Business Questions Answered

- 🏥 How many hospitals are included and what is the overall MSPB average?
- 📊 How many hospitals spend **above vs below** the national average?
- 🗺️ Which states show the highest and lowest average MSPB?
- ⭐ Does higher Medicare spending correlate with better quality ratings?
- 🏢 How does spending vary by hospital ownership type?
- 🚨 Which hospitals are extreme outliers (highest spending vs most efficient)?

## 📂 Data Sources

- **CMS Medicare Spending per Beneficiary (MSPB)**
- **CMS Hospital General Information**
- **CMS Provider Data Catalog**

All datasets are publicly available from the CMS Provider Data portal.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

### 🐍 Python — Data Ingestion & ETL

Used for repeatable ingestion and preprocessing before loading into SQL Server.

- **pandas**  
  - Load and clean raw CSV files  
  - Handle missing values and data types  
  - Standardize column naming  

- **numpy**  
  - Numeric calculations and transformations  

- **urllib**  
  - Dataset retrieval and file handling  

- **SQLAlchemy + pyodbc**  
  - Database connectivity  
  - Load cleaned DataFrames into SQL Server tables  

---

### 🗄️ SQL Server — Data Modeling & Analytics

SQL Server is the **core analytical layer** of this project.

- Clean base views with enforced data types
- Feature engineering in SQL:
  - MSPB % vs national average
  - Cost-efficiency tiers
- **Window functions** (`ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY ...)`) to deduplicate hospitals
- Reusable **views** for:
  - KPIs
  - Regional aggregation
  - Rankings
  - Ownership and quality analysis
- Data quality checks:
  - Duplicate detection
  - Null validation
  - Row-count reconciliation

---

### 📊 Power BI — Visualization & Reporting

Power BI is used **strictly for visualization**, with business logic handled upstream in SQL.

- Executive KPI cards
- Filled U.S. map (state-level MSPB averages)
- Bar charts for:
  - Spending vs quality ratings
  - Spending vs ownership type
- Ranked tables for:
  - Highest-spending hospitals
  - Most cost-efficient hospitals
- Interactive slicers for exploration

> Design choice: SQL views were intentionally used instead of heavy DAX to improve transparency, performance, and scalability.

## 🔄 End-to-End Pipeline

### Step 1: Data Acquisition
- Download CMS MSPB and Hospital General Information datasets
- Store raw files separately from processed data

### Step 2: Python Cleaning & Validation
- Remove suppressed and invalid MSPB scores
- Filter to **MSPB-1** measure only
- Convert numeric and categorical fields
- Validate row counts before and after cleaning

### Step 3: Load to SQL Server
- Use SQLAlchemy engine to load cleaned datasets
- Enables repeatable, automated ingestion

### Step 4: SQL Modeling
- Create a canonical MSPB base view (1 row per hospital)
- Engineer derived metrics and efficiency tiers
- Deduplicate hospital records prior to joins
- Build analytical views for Power BI consumption

### Step 5: Power BI Reporting
- Connect directly to SQL views
- Build executive dashboards
- Validate metrics against SQL results

---

## 🧠 Data Modeling Highlights

### Deduplication Strategy

CMS hospital datasets can contain multiple records per Facility ID.  
If not handled, joins inflate metrics and distort insights.

This project uses:

- `ROW_NUMBER()` partitioned by Facility ID
- Deterministic row selection
- One-row-per-hospital enforcement

This ensures:
- Accurate KPIs
- Correct averages
- Reliable dashboards

---

### KPI Engineering

A dedicated KPI view ensures:
- One-row summary dataset
- Exact numeric reporting (no “K” abbreviations)
- Consistent executive metrics across visuals

---

### Executive Overview
- Total hospitals
- Average MSPB
- Hospitals above vs below national average
- Geographic variation via filled U.S. map

### Cost Drivers & Outcomes
- Average MSPB by quality rating
- Average MSPB by ownership type
- Top high-spending hospitals
- Top cost-efficient hospitals
- Executive insight summary

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Medicare spending varies significantly by state
- Higher spending does **not** consistently result in better quality ratings
- Ownership structure explains more spending variation than quality alone
- A small subset of hospitals drives extreme cost inefficiencies
